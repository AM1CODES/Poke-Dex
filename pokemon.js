		pokemonDescription:
			'Gible is a small, blue, bipedal dragon-like Pokémon. It lacks a neck but has a large mouth, filled with sharp teeth. It has two horns on its head striped blue in the middle, and a large dorsal fin. Gible loves to bite anything, and that can be a pain for its Trainer if the Trainer gets bitten themselves. This habit of biting anything is probably instinctive, and it is very hard to train them to control their urges.',
