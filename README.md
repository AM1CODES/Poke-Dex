There's no doubt that most  of our childhood was spent watching Pokémon and playing games like Pokémon Fire-Red, Ruby, Emerald, etc. From Kanto to Hoenn to Sinnoh, we have seen it all and experienced it all. With Hacktoberfest 2020 coming up and being one of the people who would participate for the very first time, I decided to create this repository that's actually a very basic web-page that lets the user view and add their favourite pokemons.

# Contents of the Webpage

1. index.html - Contains the content of the main/home page.
2. index.css -  Contains the styling given to the  home page.
3. about.html - Contains a little information about me.
4. about.css -  Contains the styling given to the about page.

# But what if i don't know how to add cards :(

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code below to add the your own card because everyone loves Pokémon and everyone should get a chance to add their favourite Pokémons!

Code - 

                <div class="col-lg-4 mb-4">
                    <div class="card">
                        <img class="card-img-top" src="[Link to Pokémon image]" alt="">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <h5 class="card-title">[Name of your favourite Pokémon]</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">[Small Description about your Pokémon]</p>
                            <a href="[Add the link to your Github Profile]" class="btn btn-outline-danger btn-sm">Contributed by - [Add your Github Username/profile name]</a>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
