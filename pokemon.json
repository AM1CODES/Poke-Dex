It has two horns on its head striped blue in the middle, and a large dorsal fin. Gible loves to bite anything, and that can be a pain for its Trainer if the Trainer gets bitten themselves. This habit of biting anything is probably instinctive, and it is very hard to train them to control their urges.",
